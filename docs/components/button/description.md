# Frost-Button

## Summary
Buttons are state manipulating actions scoped to the current route (a client page, identified by URL).

To provide a focus for user interaction, route actions (buttons/links) should provide guidance for the intended workflows of a route. A route should only ever have one primary workflow, but may have multiple secondary or tertiary workflows. Secondary and tertiary workflows are differentiated by the expected frequency and precedence of the workflows using those actions and are therefore a fluid concept (judgement calls based on the route UX).
## Visual design
Sizing of related buttons
Related buttons (e.g. buttons that apply to a table, buttons on a modal dialog) should have equal width and height regardless of the size of the text in each button.

## Style specification
Primary precedence
A maximum of one button/link per route should have primary precedence.
